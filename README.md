- The **.NET 9** SDK.
- An **SQL Server** installation (Developer, Express, Docker Container)
- A database management tool like **SQL Server Management Studio** or **DBeaver** (optional, only required if you need to run the `GetRanking` stored procedure).

### Installation Steps

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps are examples for terminal/command prompt.
>
> You may need to adjust them based on your specific operating system and environment.

1. Clone the repository:

   - `git clone https://github.com/TheCSharpAcademy/TCSA.V2026.git`

2. Navigate to the application project directory:

   - `cd TCSA.V2026\TCSA.V2026`

3. Create a `appsettings.json` file:

   - `notepad appsettings.json`

4. Paste the following, adjust any values specific to your environment. Save and close.

```json
{
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB; Initial Catalog=TCSA_V2026; Integrated Security=true;"
    },
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "Values": {
        "GithubClientId": "abc123",
        "GithubClientSecret": "abc123"
    },
    "Discord": {
        "Token": "ODAzMzc3MjcwODc4MTA5NzI2.tHis.IS.not.A.ReAl.tOkeN"
  }
}
```

> [!Tip]
> Replace `DefaultConnection` with your own connection string.
>
> If you want to login via GitHub, replace `GithubClientId` and `GithubClientSecret` with your own values.
>
> **Github Docs**: [Creating an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

5. Open the solution `TCSA.V2026.sln`.

6. Go to `Program.cs` and uncomment the following lines:

```
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    SeedData.Seed(app.Services);
}
```

> [!Note]
> After running the application you can comment out these lines again to avoid database recreation on every startup.
>
> Make sure to repeat this step when database schema changes or new seeding data is added.

7. Run the project.

    - `dotnet run`

8. Login as fake user

   - You can find several fake users in `Data/SeedData.cs`
   - Below is login info from a seeded user with Orange belt and 1000 XP points:

```plaintext
Username: user1@example.com
Password: Password123!
```

#### GetRanking Store Procedure

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This stored procedure must be created if you want to access the leaderboard pages.
>
> Use your database management tool of choice and ensure you are connected to the correct database before running the below script.

```
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetRanking]
    @userId NVARCHAR(450),
    @ranking INT OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @userExperiencePoints INT;

    -- Get the user's experience points based on the provided user ID
    SELECT @userExperiencePoints = [ExperiencePoints]
    FROM [AspNetUsers]
    WHERE [Id] = @userId;

    -- Calculate the user's ranking
    SELECT @ranking = COUNT(*) + 1
FROM [AspNetUsers]
WHERE [ExperiencePoints] > @userExperiencePoints
   OR ([ExperiencePoints] = @userExperiencePoints AND (
       [FirstName] < (SELECT [FirstName] FROM [AspNetUsers] WHERE [Id] = @userId) OR
       ([FirstName] = (SELECT [FirstName] FROM [AspNetUsers] WHERE [Id] = @userId) AND [LastName] < (SELECT [LastName] FROM [AspNetUsers] WHERE [Id] = @userId))
   ));
END;
GO
```
