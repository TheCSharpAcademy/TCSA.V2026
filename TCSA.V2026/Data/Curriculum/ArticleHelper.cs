The general headquarters of my organization will be <a href='https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r' target='_blank'>Google Calendar</a>. I think it’s a great tool for having a big picture of one’s schedule. It’s great that I can combine it with <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1' target='_blank'>Google Tasks</a> and drag and drop tasks onto my calendar. <a href='https://amzn.to/4cn6NvP' target='_blank'>I use the Getting Things Done method</a> by the great David Allen. It’s an absolute game changer. To summarize, the idea is to dump every possible thing that’s in your mind into lists organized by topics and priority. When I first tried it, it felt like removing one ton off my back. I no longer had to worry about forgotten tasks that weren’t registered anywhere. Obviously the things I had to do hadn’t disappeared, but they were now accounted for, part of a system. Thank you David, I get much more done because of you."

I was disciplined enough to say no to the temptation of jumping around amongst several tasks and dedicated 27 hours to building the new website for The C# Academy in the last 10 days. What’s driving this surge is the fact that this is a finite project. Getting it out of the way will allow me to go back to spending more time in the ongoing task of creating amazing educational content. I hope to have the new version out within a week 💪🏻."

The set of circumstances that allowed him to achieve greatness is enlightening. As an example, he went to one of the first schools to give students unlimited access to a computer. So he amassed his thousands of hours of programming practice before almost everyone else on the planet! Is he extremely intelligent? Did he work hard? Yes and yes. Would he have impacted the world the way he did if he didn’t go to that school? It’s highly unlikely. "
