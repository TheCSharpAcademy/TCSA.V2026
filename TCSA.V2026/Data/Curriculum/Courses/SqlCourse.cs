The parent (the \"one\" side) can have many children (the \"many\" side), but each child can only have one parent. For example, a Category can have many Products, but each Product belongs to only one Category. In a family, each person (e.g., a cousin) can have multiple cousins, and each cousin can also have multiple cousins. So, the relationship is reciprocal and can involve many-to-many interactions." }
