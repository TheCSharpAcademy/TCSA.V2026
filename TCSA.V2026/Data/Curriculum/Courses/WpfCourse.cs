It’s just a file on disk, making deployment very simple.<br>\r\n\r\n🚀 <b>Performance</b>: For read-heavy operations or modest write workloads, SQLite is super efficient. It can handle thousands of records easily for everyday apps.<br>\r\n\r\n💾 <b>Persistence</b>: Data is stored in a .db file, giving users durable storage even between sessions or reboots.<br>\r\n\r\n🔌 <b>EF Core Compatibility</b>: You can pair SQLite with Entity Framework Core for smooth data modeling and LINQ queries, which plays nicely with WPF.<br>\r\n\r\n🛠️ <b>Great for Prototyping</b>: Whether you're testing out new UI concepts or iterating fast, SQLite lets you focus on features without fretting over the backend."
