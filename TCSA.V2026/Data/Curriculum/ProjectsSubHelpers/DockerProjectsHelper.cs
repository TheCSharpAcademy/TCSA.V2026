One of the coolest latest concepts popularized in the world of software development is containerization, a technique for bundling an application along with all its necessary dependencies and configurations into a single, self-contained unit: the so-called container. This container can run reliably across different computing environments, whether it's on a developer’s laptop, a test server, or in production on the cloud."
